The four tracks in this piece are: grand piano, slow strings, xenon pad,
and music box.

This arrangement is based on the popular melody of the nursery rhyme
called <em>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</em>. The melody is played with
the treble notes of the piano. I wrote the bass notes for the piano and
the strings, and the high notes for the pad and the music box to fill
the music with emotions of love and happiness. I recorded this after
about two hours of practice.
