<h2 id="hobby">Hobby</h2>
<p>
  I have a keen interest in free and open source software. I have been a
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">contributor
  of security features</a> to
  <a href="http://nutch.apache.org/">Apache Nutch</a>, an open source
  search engine.
</p>
<p>
  I also develop and maintain a few open source projects of my own at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
  When not involved with technology, I like reading books, <a
  href="{{ root }}music/">playing the piano</a>, and travelling.
</p>

<h2 id="online">Online Presence</h2>
<p>
  I am usually online as <code>spal</code> (my nick) on
  <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">Freenode IRC</a>. I hang out
  at various channels like <code>#lisp</code>, <code>#python</code>,
  <code>#debian</code>, <code>##math</code>, <code>##algorithms</code>,
  <code>##security</code>, etc. After connecting to the network, enter
  <code>/query spal</code> to talk to me.

<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>
  I have been told many times that my name, <em>"Susam"</em>, is a
  little unusual which makes it difficult for others to figure how to
  pronounce it. It is pronounced almost like the English words <em>"sue
  sum"</em>. Here's the IPA pronunciation of my name:
  <em>/suː'sʌm/</em>. However you may call my name however you find most
  natural, convenient, or intuitive. I do not mind mispronunciations of
  my name at all whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
  I am also often asked if my name has any meaning. My parents say it is
  a fusion of two words <em>"su"</em> and <em>"sam"</em>. In many Indian
  languages, <em>"su"</em> means <em>good</em> and <em>"sam"</em> means
  <em>even</em>, so my name is supposed to mean good and even.
