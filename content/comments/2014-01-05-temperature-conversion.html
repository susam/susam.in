&minus;40&nbsp;&deg;C = &minus;40&nbsp;&deg;F.

A related joke:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Saul: It's &minus;40 outside.
</p>
<p>
Paul: Fahrenheit or Celsius?
</p>
<p>
Saul: When it's that cold, it's impossible to tell the difference.

16&nbsp;&deg;C = 61&nbsp&deg;F. Much more useful summer conversion
temperature in Ireland.

It doesn't help much for people visiting here in the US, but when I
travel outside the country I use this handy rhyme: 30 is hot. 20 is
nice. 10 is cold. 0 is ice.

The way I convert is to remember that 32&nbsp;&deg;F is 0&nbsp;&deg;C
and then count by "nines" for Fahrenheit to get the desired temperature
in Celsius.
</p>
<p>
32&nbsp;&deg;F =  0&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
41&nbsp;&deg;F =  5&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
50&nbsp;&deg;F = 10&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
59&nbsp;&deg;F = 15&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
68&nbsp;&deg;F = 20&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
77&nbsp;&deg;F = 25&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
86&nbsp;&deg;F = 30&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
95&nbsp;&deg;F = 35&nbsp;&deg;C
</p>
<p>
It's also pretty easy to remember that 10&nbsp;&deg;C = 50&nbsp;&deg;F
and 35&nbsp;&deg;C = 95&nbsp;&deg;F if you want to go forward or back
from there with the same counting method.
