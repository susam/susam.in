Very nice solution! It is quite interesting that this does not work for
\( e^x. \) I wonder if there is any general way to tell for any
function.

This is a nice example for why the axiom of choice is controversial. The
proof from this blog post only works because of it. However, the result
seems counter-intuitive. Let us have a look at whether this is only our
intuition being off or whether functions with these properties are just
"weird".
</p>
<p>
When speaking of periodic functions the first that comes to mind is the
\( \sin \) function. Can something similar to such a function be used to
construct the functions \( g \) and \( h \) from the blog post? If we
define them similar to \( \sin \) as periodic and continuous, then the
answer is no. Every periodic and continuous function has a maximum
value. The sum of two functions with a maximum value has a maximum
value. However, the identity is unbounded. The sum can therefore not be
the identity.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so \( \sin \)-like functions are out. What about \( \tan \)-like
functions? For example \( \tan(x) \) and \( -\tan(2x) \)? Those are not
continuous everywhere. Well, we can also rule out many functions like
this. Suppose \( g \) and \( h \) are two periodic functions with period
lengths \( a \) and \( b \). If \( \frac{a}{b} \) is rational, then the
sum of \( g \) and \( h \) cannot be the identity function. Suppose that
\( \frac{a}{b} \) was rational, then \( ab \) is a common period of both
functions, i.e., \( g(x) = g(x + ab) \) and \( h(x) = h(x + ab). \) It
follows that \( (g + h)(x) = (g + h)(x + ab). \) As \( a \) and \( b \)
are non-zero, it follows that \( g + h \) cannot be the identity
function. Functions of the form \( a \tan(bx) \) for rational \( b \)
thus do not work. Any two periodic functions where you can reason about
their sum by just looking at what happens for individual periods are
thus ruled out.
</p>
<p>
My conclusion is that the two periodic functions from the blog post must
look "weird".
</p>
<p>
A common theme with axiom of choice proofs is also that they show the
existence of something but give no hint at how this something actually
looks like. The proof in this blog post is a good example of this. We
know that the functions "exist" but have absolutely no clue about how
they look like. It is also an open question whether describing them in
any other way than "the function from this proof" is even possible.
