<h2>Mathematical Valentine</h2>

<p>
It's Valentine's Day. It's that time of the year when many math geeks
put their skills to creative use by drawing hearts with mathematical
equations. For example, see this <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1xwuv3/a_mathematical_valentine/">Mathematical
Valentine on Reddit</a>. One of the popular ways of plotting a heart I
have seen discussed on the Internet is plotting a cardoid. For example,
see <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1xwuv3/a_mathematical_valentine/cffdxt9/">this
comment</a> by on the same thread.

A cardoid is a curve traced by a point on the perimeter of a circle that
rolls around a fixed circle of the same radius. See this <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid">Wikipedia article on
cardiod</a> for more details about it. Here is how it looks:

    \( x(\varphi) = 2a (1 - \cos\varphi) \cos \varphi, \)
    &nbsp;
    \( y(\varphi) = 2a (1 - \cos\varphi) \sin \varphi, \)
    where \( 0 \le \varphi \lt 2\pi \)
  </figcaption>

<p>
In fact, the cardoid is named so due to its heart-like shape. However, I
wanted something that resembles the heart in playing cards more than it
resembles a cardoid, so I plotted a simpler heart for <a
href="https://sunainapai.in/">my girlfriend</a>. This simpler heart is
composed of two simple curves:

\begin{align*}
y & = \sqrt{1 - |x|} \sqrt{|x|}, \\
y & = -\frac{3}{2} \sqrt{1 - \sqrt{|x|}}.
\end{align*}

Here is what the graph plot looks like: <a

Here is the source code for the above plot: <a

In this post, I'll describe how I arrived at the two equations above.

<h2>Semicircles</h2>

<p>
We start with a circle of radius \( \frac{1}{2} \) centred at \(
\left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \) and derive its equation:

\begin{align*}
  & \left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \\
  & \iff x^2 - x + y^2 = 0 \\
  & \iff y^2 = x(1 - x).
\end{align*}
