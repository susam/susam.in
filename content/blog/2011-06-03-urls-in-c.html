<!-- title: URLs in C -->

<p>
Here is an interesting C puzzle I created recently. It is a silly one
but you mind it amusing.
</p>

<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    http://susam.in/
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>
This code compiles and runs successfully even though the <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
standard</a> doesn't mention anywhere that URLs are valid syntactic
elements in C. How does this code work then?
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Update on 02 Oct 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been solved
in the <a href="comments/">comments</a> section. If you want to think
about the problem before you see the solutions, this is a good time to
pause and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>

<p>
The code works fine because <code>http:</code> is a label and
<code>//</code> following it begins a comment. In case, you are
wondering if <code>//</code> is indeed a valid comment in C, yes, it is,
since C99. Download the <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
standard</a> and go to section 6.4.9 (Comments) and read the second
point which mentions this:
</p>

<blockquote>
Except within a character constant, a string literal, or a comment, the
characters <code>//</code> introduce a comment that includes all
multibyte characters up to, but not including, the next new-line
character.The contents of such a comment are examined only to identify
multibyte characters and to find the terminating new-line character.
</blockquote>
